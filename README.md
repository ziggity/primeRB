# _Prime List finder_

#### _Prime_

## Description

_Prime Sifting
Given a number, write a method that returns all of the prime numbers less than that number.

This is a tricky problem, and I want you to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to solve it. Here's how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works to find a number up to a given number:

Create a list of numbers from 2 through n: 2, 3, 4, ..., number.
Initially, let prime equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from prime, remove all multiples of prime from the list.
Increment prime by 1.
When you reach number, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes.
You also might find this video helpful in explaining the Sieve._
